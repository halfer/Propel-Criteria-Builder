<h2>Examples to tackle</h2>

<pre>
Example 1: (A AND B AND (C OR (D AND E)))
Tree:    AND
         |
      A, B, OR
            |
            C, AND
               |
               D, E
</pre>

<hr/>

<pre>
Example 2: (A OR B OR (C OR D))
Tree:     OR
           |
        A, B, OR
              |
              C, D

Simplification process: detect adjacent ORs
</pre>
<hr/>

<pre>
Example 3: (A AND B OR C)
Error: intended precedence unclear
</pre>

<hr/>

<pre>
Example 4: A = 1 AND A = 2
Could this be detected and a warning noted? After simplification, this breaks down to: if the same variable 
appears twice in an AND clause, show a warning
</pre>

<hr/>

<pre>
Example 5: set up joins, individually selected columns, ORDER BYs, GROUP BYs, HAVINGs.
